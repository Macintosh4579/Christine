* Improve the plugins interface
* Create configure dialogs for plugins
	* pidgin
	* twitter
* Improve plugin last.fm
	There are a lot of things here. Im thinking on:
	* Let the user mark loved tracks
	* Let the user add a track to a playlist
	* The 'must-have' now playing
	* Fetch the current item album cover
* Improve the search stuff, currently there is a freeze while the search is
  being done.
* Create playlist "types" where radio stations may be allocated
* Create more artwork to support last.fm, radio stations, video.
* Create a plugin to give iPod support to christine.
* All string must be translatable.
