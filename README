Christine Media Player is a python/gstreamer based Media Player.

This program is inteded to be easy to use and small. Most people
want to listen music and view viedeos, earing their subscribed
podcasts or internet radio stations.

We want to create something that fits this. 

Features:

- Plays all audio/video formats available in your Gstreamer 
    installation.
- Manage Music "sources" (Music/video libraries and Radio stations)
    and a queue where you can put whatever you want to play in 
    order.
- It fits in 32Mb of ram, we want to make it fit in less.
- It's very simple to use.
- It handles some "extra" features called plugins, the are
    work in progress.
- Runs on Posix compilant and win32.
